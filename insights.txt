INSIGHTS:

1. Global Emissions Trend  
Total CO₂ emissions have increased steadily since 2000, with a dip in 2020 due to COVID-19. However, emissions rebounded swiftly post-pandemic, revealing that deeper energy reforms are required beyond short-term interruptions.

2. Geographic Distribution  
China, the United States, and India account for over half of global emissions. Interestingly, smaller countries often have much higher per capita emissions, which highlights the importance of looking beyond just totals when designing climate policies.

3. Fuel Type Contribution  
Coal remains the highest contributor to global emissions, followed by oil and gas. While renewable energy capacity is growing, fossil fuels still dominate the energy sector in most countries.

4. Country-Specific Emissions Mix  
The emissions mix varies significantly: China emits the most from coal, the U.S. from oil, and Russia from gas. This underscores the need for decarbonization plans tailored to each country’s energy dependency.

5. Key Takeaway  
Global climate goals require targeted insights. A data-driven breakdown of emissions by fuel and geography offers policymakers clarity and urgency on where action is most needed.
