#  Global CO₂ Emissions Tracker (Internship Project – Data Analyst)

This project tracks global carbon emissions across countries and sectors using data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/co2-data).  
Built as part of my 2-week internship project for visualizing and analyzing real-world emissions data.

---

##  Objective

- Analyze CO₂ emissions trends across time, geography, and sectors
- Prepare a cleaned dataset suitable for visual dashboards
- Build a Tableau dashboard for global climate insights

---

##  ETL Summary (Phase 1 Complete)

- Filtered dataset from 2000 onwards
- Removed irrelevant and high-null columns
- Recalculated `co2_per_capita` and `co2_per_gdp`
- Handled sectoral CO₂ (coal, gas, oil) using country/global medians
- Exported final cleaned CSV for Tableau

---

##  Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook (ETL and analysis)
- Tableau (for visual dashboard – in progress)

---

##  Next Steps

- Begin Tableau dashboard design (maps, filters, bar & line charts)
- Write insights & policy brief
- Export dashboard as screenshot/PDF
